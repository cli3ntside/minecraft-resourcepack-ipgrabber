# minecraft resourcepack ipgrabber
funny idea i had that i wrote in a few minutes.
this creates a direct downloadlink which when used will send the ip of the downloader to a webhook
i used it to make a server resourcepack ip grabber for minecraft to grab ips on minehut servers as you dont have access to console there

example of usage:
